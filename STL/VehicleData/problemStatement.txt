create a class called VehicleData
    - alphanumeric vehicleId;
    - string for vehicleModel
    - enumeration literals of SEDAN,SUV & HATCHBACK fro vehicleType;
    - integer value for fuelTankCapacity;
    - decimal number for mileage(expected as per company)

    - required constructors
    - ability to gain read and write access pf data members
    - ability to display all data members
    - ability to add 2 vechicleData objects to return combined fuel capacity

create 2 lambda functions to do following

    a) calculate AVerageFuelCapacity from all VehicleData objects passed in a container and return the answer.

    b) find mileage of vehcile with a given vehicleId and return the answer.

Store both function into a list of std::function vehicleType

create a function operation that takes VehicleData objects in a container and a container
containing all the function objects.

apply each function on collection of VehicleData objects
