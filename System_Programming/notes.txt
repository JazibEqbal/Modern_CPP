KERNEL manages hardware, processes, I/O, Security etc.

Most kernel os are written in C language -- bcz it was very close to the hardware and high level 
                                            language and functionally usable
                                    
a process can run infintely threads but on one core can run 2 threads at a time

systemd -- a parent service that starts upon booting

every process follows parent-child relationship except systemd(itself act as a parent on behalf of kernel)

when we ask a os to do something we make a sys call

with threading you share memory but with multithreading you don'that
