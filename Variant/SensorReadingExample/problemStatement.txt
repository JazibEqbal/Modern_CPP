create a class SensonReading
a) a sensorId could be int or string
b) a readingId could be int or string
c) a type or reading (acceptable,ERROR,DEFAULT)
d) ability to default construct the instance of this class
e) ability to copy the instance into another
f) ability to move the instance into another
g) ability to gain read, write access & display attributes
h) a reading value (could be float)

create 5 instances of SensonReading class.

create lambda functions to do the following

a) find sensor id for the sensor with the highest reading value

b) find avg sensor reading value for all sensors whose IDs are passed in a 
   data container to the lambda function

c) find the reading type for ONE Sensor whose ID is passed as a paramter

d) find and return instances of SensonReading whose sensor reading value is above a threshold
   paramter passed as an argument to the lambda

e) find the first N sensors amongst the Data container where 0<=N<=size of the container
   and N is provided as an argument to the lambda
