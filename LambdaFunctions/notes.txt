capture by value (copy)

1) if we use = in capture parameter brackets [], we get access to all variables declared before this statement 
   in the enclosing function but this access by default is read only. We can use "mutalble" keyword to gain write 
   access.

2) If we don't want all variables to get copied but only specific variables, you can write them directly inside
   []. for e.g: [n1]. Mutablewill still be required for write modification.

capture by reference (original data referenced)

3) If we use & in capture parameter brackets[], we get access to all variables declared before this statement
   in the enclosing function.This access is both read and write.

   If we don't want all variables to get referenced but only specific variables, you can write them directly 
   inside[], for e.g: [&n1].
